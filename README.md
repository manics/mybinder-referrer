# mybinder-referrer example

Example of redirecting to mybinder based on the referrer header.

**Click** on this link: https://www.manicstreetpreacher.co.uk/mybinder-referrer/

And you should see another link that loads **this** repository in mybinder.
This works by looking at the HTTP referrer and generating the mybinder URL in client-side Javascript.
